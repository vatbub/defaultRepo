<p>Hi, welcome to this AWS S3 Bucket. It's purpose is to host the maven sites of my java projects.</p><br>
<p>If you have an artifact with the groupId com.github.vatbub (which are my artifacts), you will most likely find its site here.</p><br>
<p>Just try to access <bucketHostURL>/artifactId/version/site/index.html to access the site of the artifact you are looking for.</p>
